Introduction
The pyenv for python is a great tool, but it doesn't supports windowns platform directly, which was the same case in rbenv for ruby developers. After a bit of research and feedbacks from python developers, they loves to have such a feature for windows systems.

I got inspired from the pyenv issues for windows support, personally I too use mac and linux with beautiful pyenv, but in some companies they still use windows for there development. This library is to help windows users to manage multiple pythons.

Found a similar system for rbenv-win for ruby developers. This project was forked from rbenv-win and modified for pyenv. Some commands doesn't implemented, but wouldn't be a problem in basic use.

pyenv
pyenv is a simple python version management tool. It lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.

pyenv-win does
   commands    List all available pyenv commands

   global      Set or show the global Python version
   shell       Set or show the shell-specific Python version
   install     Install a Python version using python-build
   uninstall   Uninstall a specific Python version
   rehash      Rehash pyenv shims (run this after installing executables)
   version     Show the current Python version and its origin
   versions    List all Python versions available to pyenv

To set a python version as global version. pyenv global 3.5.2 Note: version needs to be installed
To set a python version as local version. pyenv local 3.5.2 you can give any version which you wanted to use to the project, this will be auto activated by entering to the folder not like other virtual env. to activate.
To uninstall any python version. pyenv uninstall 3.5.2
To know which python you are using and it's path pyenv version
To view all the python versions installed in this system pyenv versions

Answer: You can ignore it. It's calling pyenv rehash command before creating the bat file in few devices.

Question: System is stuck while uninstalling the python version, what to do?
Answer: It's based on the system policies, you can manually uninstall by going to the path %USERPROFILE%/.pyenv/pyenv-win/install_cache/. I believe you know manual uninstallation. Please remove the site-package and scripts while uninstalling (mandatory). Double check the python version folder doesn't exist in the path %USERPROFILE%/.pyenv/pyenv-win/versions/ if exist please do remove it (mandatory).
